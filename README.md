# Labyrinth Generator project


Welcome to the labyrinth Generator project. This project provides a C program for generating and solving a labyrinth using SDL2. The generation algorithm used in this project is randomized DFS (depth-first search). This algorithm uses a recursive depth-first traversal to randomly generate a labyrinth by removing the walls between visited cells randomly. This creates winding paths and ensures that all cells in the labyrinth are accessible. These three examples of labyrinths have lengths (L) equal to 11, 23, and 119, and pixel resolutions (pix) of 40, 30, and 3, respectively.

## Dependencies

In order to use this program, you will need to have the following packages installed:

- SDL2
- SDL2_image
- SDL2_ttf

## Usage

To run the program, compile the source code with a C compiler and run the executable file. The program will generate a random labyrinth and allow the user to navigate through it using the arrow keys.



## File Structure

The `fonctions.h` header file contains function prototypes and global variables used throughout the program. The functions included in this file are:

- `connect_cell`: Connects two cells in the labyrinth by removing the wall between them.
- `Initialisation_creation`: Initializes the program and creates the window and renderer. Returns a boolean value indicating if the program is running.
- `newSDL_Rect`: Creates and returns a new SDL_Rect structure with the specified parameters.
- `rand_vois`: Returns a random neighboring cell of the specified cell.
- `Quiter_detruire`: Frees resources and quits the program.
- `setup`: Initializes variables and sets up the labyrinth.
- `processInput`: Processes user input.
- `rand_vois_nonvi`: Returns a random unvisited neighboring cell of the specified cell.
- `render`: Renders the labyrinth to the window.
- `Labyrinthe`: Generates the labyrinth using the recursive backtracking algorithm.
- `verifier`: Returns a boolean value indicating if the specified cell has been visited.

## Additional Notes

The program uses the SDL2 library to create a window and handle user input. It also uses the SDL2_image and SDL2_ttf libraries to load and display images and text. The `fonctions.h` header file contains function prototypes and global variables used throughout the program. The `main` function initializes the program, processes user input, and contains the main game loop that updates and renders the labyrinth.
